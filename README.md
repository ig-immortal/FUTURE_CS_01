Task 1: Vulnerability Assessment Report
As part of my Cyber Security Internship at Future Interns, I conducted an in-depth Vulnerability Assessment to identify potential security flaws, analyze risks, and recommend effective countermeasures. Key Highlights of the Assessment
Security Scanning – Used OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Nmap to detect vulnerabilities. Threat Analysis – Investigated SQL Injection, XSS, IDOR, and security misconfigurations. Network Security Review – Evaluated exposed services, weak authentication, and open ports. Remediation Planning – Proposed MFA enforcement, secure coding, WAF integration, and penetration testing. Tools Used
OWASP ZAP – Identified web vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and XSS. Burp Suite – Analyzed session hijacking, authentication weaknesses, and open redirects. Nmap – Scanned network services to detect open ports and database exposure risks. Skills Developed
Security Scanning & Testing – Hands-on experience with automated and manual vulnerability analysis. Threat Impact Assessment – Evaluated risks and their potential impact on systems and data. Cybersecurity Best Practices – Recommended secure authentication, encryption, and firewalls. Incident Prevention Strategies – Strengthened security posture through patching and monitoring. Why This Project Matters
Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, making vulnerability assessments essential in safeguarding digital assets. Through this project, Future Interns gain:
Real-world exposure to penetration testing and risk assessment. Critical thinking in identifying and mitigating cyber threats. Experience in network security and secure application development.
Conclusion The Vulnerability Assessment Report provided valuable hands-on experience in analyzing system weaknesses, improving security controls, and implementing proactive defense strategies. By continuously enhancing security measures, organizations can significantly reduce cyber risks and ensure a safer digital environment.
